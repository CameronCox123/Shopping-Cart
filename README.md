# Shopping-Cart
Implements two classes to be used in creating item descriptions and a shopping cart. 

Item_To_Purchase takes a name, price, and quantity variables to create a new item object in memory
Shopping_Cart takes a customer ID and list of item objects. 

The driver code has a few pre-built lines to demonstrate the creation of item objects,
a shopping cart, and how to use the methods
